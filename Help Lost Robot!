PROBLEM STATEMENT:- 
Help Lost Robot!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Robot Bunny is lost. It wants to reach its home as soon as possible.
Currently it is standing at coordinates (x1, y1) in 2-D plane. Its home is at coordinates (x2, y2).
Bunny is extremely worried. Please help it by giving a command by telling the direction in which it should to go so as to reach its home. If you give it a direction, it will keep moving in that direction till it reaches its home. There are four possible directions you can give as command - "left", "right", "up", "down". It might be possible that you can't instruct the robot in such a way that it reaches its home. In that case, output "sad".

Input
First line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. T test cases follow.

First line of each test case contains four space separated integers x1, y1, x2, y2.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing "left" or "right" or "up" or "down" or "sad" (without quotes).

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 5000
0 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2. ≤ 100
It's guaranteed that the initial position of robot is not his home.
Example
Input
3
0 0 1 0
0 0 0 1
0 0 1 1

Output:

up
sad
Explanation

SOLUTION:-

#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
	int t,x,y,x1,y1;
	scanf("%d",&t);
	while(t--)
	{
		scanf("%d%d%d%d",&x,&y,&x1,&y1);
		if(x1==x&&y1>y)
		printf("up\n");
		if(x1==x&&y1<y)
		printf("down\n");
		if(y1==y&&x1>x)
		printf("right\n");
		if(y1==y&&x1<x)
		printf("left\n");
		if(x1!=x&&y1!=y)
		printf("sad\n");
		
	}
}
